        <div class="about-container">
            
                <p>Scarlet Witch, portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), is a powerful and pivotal character introduced in 
                    "Avengers: Age of Ultron" (2015). Born as Wanda Maximoff in the fictional Eastern European country of Sokovia, 
                    she and her twin brother Pietro (Quicksilver) initially gained their powers through experiments with the Mind Stone, conducted by the villainous organization HYDRA. Wanda's abilities include telekinesis, energy manipulation, and reality-warping, 
                    making her one of the most formidable Avengers. Throughout the MCU, her character evolves from a vengeful adversary to a devoted member of the Avengers.</p>
                <p>
                    Wanda's journey in the MCU is marked by significant personal losses and struggles. She loses her brother Pietro in "Age of Ultron," and her lover, Vision, 
                    in "Avengers: Infinity War" (2018). Her grief and pain culminate in the Disney+ series "WandaVision" (2021), where she creates a false reality to cope with
                     her losses, inadvertently taking an entire town hostage. The series explores her deep emotional struggles and leads to her transformation into the Scarlet Witch,
                a being of immense magical power foretold by prophecy. Wanda's story continues in "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" (2022), where her character grapples with the consequences of her actions and the full extent of her powers.
